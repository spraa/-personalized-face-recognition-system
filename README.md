## ⚡ Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Uses datasets like [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for training and testing the system.  
   - Cleans and preprocesses data for feature extraction and normalization.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Trains machine learning models to understand user preferences.  
   - Implements collaborative filtering for user-to-user and item-to-item recommendations.  
   - Uses content-based filtering for analyzing movie features and genres.  

3. **User Interaction**:  
   - Accepts user input (ratings or preferences) via a web-based interface.  
   - Generates and displays movie recommendations dynamically.
